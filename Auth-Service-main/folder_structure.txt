main.py — the front door / router. Starts the app and plugs in routes.

database.py — the wiring to Supabase. One place to change DB credentials.

schemas.py — the forms and rules. Pydantic models that validate incoming/outgoing data.

utils.py — the toolbox (hashing, JWT helpers). Reusable logic lives here.

deps.py — the shared guards/middlewares (e.g., get_current_user) that many routes use.

auth.py — the auth controller — register/login/me endpoints.

.env / requirements.txt — config and dependency list.

Why split?

Separation of concerns: each file has one job → easier to debug.

Reusability: other parts of your system can import just the bits they need.

Testability: easier to unit-test small modules.

Scalability: when the project grows (roles, refresh tokens, email), you’ll thank yourself.
